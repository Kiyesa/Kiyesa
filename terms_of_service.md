- Last modification date: `January 01, 2022`

#### BEFORE YOU START: The following terms of service indicate under which conditions we will and will not serve you. The following agreements, including your legal rights and more, become effective from the time you start using our service. Under no circumstances can you withdraw from the agreement below once you start using our service.

## INTRODUCTORY

> Welcome to Kiyesa! The following agreement is a legally binding agreement between us ("Kiyesa" or "KY" or "Service") and you ("you" or "your"). This agreement explains the conditions under which we will serve you. Kiyesa is a dictionary that anyone can contribute to. Therefore, Kiyesa can never be held responsible for the content created by people.

To be able to use KY's services, you must be over the age of majority in your country. If the age of majority in any country is younger or older than the general age of consent 18 (eighteen), the procedure is applied accordingly. This transaction is subject to verification. In short, you have to authenticate (by your National ID.) to be able to perform this action.

KY reserves the right to update the rights and agreements written herein. We will try to notify you of any changes made here. After the change, if you decide not to accept the items, you will have 10 (ten) days to terminate the service. After 10 (ten) days, you will have to accept the contract that we have changed.

Kiyesa is a game bot. It works on Discord. In any dispute (in terms of legal or other agreements), the items determined by Discord are considered superior. Currencies, which are the currency (or currencies) Kiyesa uses, cannot be reconciled with real life. Kiyesa is not a real gambling game. It just aims to have fun.

You can get some free/paid content from Kiyesa. This grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-subauthorized entitlement. If you also agree not to do (try not to) do the items given below;

- Using the Service for any purpose other than those expressly stated in these Terms,
- Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, copying, adapting, modifying, preparing derivative works from, distributing, licensing, selling, transferring, publicly displaying, publicly performing, distributing, broadcasting, broadcasting, publishing any source code of the Service or any part thereof, except as expressly permitted in these Terms attempt to learn, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or use data mining, robots, spiders or similar data collection and extraction tools on the Service

Except as expressly granted in these Terms, no authority or right is granted to you pursuant to or indirectly, any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by the Company and its licensors.

Kiyesa may terminate, destroy, modify, transfer, re-identify, and do anything it wishes, your Service upon notice (or without notice) to you. Violating or failing to comply with the clauses we have outlined in the Agreements may immediately suspend your access to the Services or reserve the right to take further action.

Kiyesa creates the Treasury with the taxes it collects. No authority can decide what to do with this treasure. **Treasury** belongs to the bot.

## YOUR CONTENT

Kiyesa provides access to its services using your Discord account. Any information you give us is not shared with third sources. (At least, without notice to you.) Kiyesa uses the following information on Discord, processes, keeps data (anonymously), analyzes, deletes, destroys, organizes and can perform all other actions that we cannot list here. To give an example, your information that will be shared publicly is: Your Account ID, Account balance, etc. Examples of your information that will not be shared with everyone are: Purchases you have made from us (online, real money purchases.) and other matters. 

Kiyesa complies with the laws created by Discord. What does this mean? So if your account is banned by Discord, we don't have to transfer to another account. 

You cannot claim Intellectual Property Rights from any service we provide to you, including content you have produced yourself. You agree that you will not modify, copy, distribute, edit, reproduce, republish, download, clean up, display, post, distribute, or sell the Service Materials, in whole or in part, in any form or by any means, without our express prior written consent. you are doing. You agree that you do not acquire any ownership rights by using the Service or by accessing the Service Materials or derivative works posted by KY on the Service. All rights not expressly granted by these Terms are reserved by KY and its licensors, and no authorization is granted herein by way of exclusion, indirect or other means.

By repeating the above agreement, you cannot hold Kiyesa and its employees responsible for any behavior you have done again. For example, like the names you have set. Kiyesa is always against violence, profanity, extremism. However, as all individuals over the age of 18 have access to Kiyesa as stated in the above articles, you agree that you will view images/content from Kiyesa that may affect you more, such as violence, blood, brutality and more. Kiyesa will clean/destroy/block these contents as they see them. If you see this content, you agree to notify us.

##  VIRTUAL CURRENCIES, VIRTUAL GOODS, AND TERMS OF SALE

We will not charge you a fee to use the basic functionality of the Service, but fees may be charged for certain products and services. For additional terms regarding our Premium subscription service, please see the “Premium Subscriptions” section below.

The Service may include an opportunity to obtain virtual currency ("Virtual Currency") or virtual goods ("Virtual Goods") that may require you to pay a fee using legal tender (that is, "real money") to obtain the Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods. Your purchase of Virtual Currency is final and is not refundable, exchangeable, transferable, except in the KY’s or the platform provider’s sole discretion. You may not purchase, sell, or exchange Virtual Currency outside the Service. Doing so is a violation of the Terms and may result in termination of your Account with the Service and/or legal action. The Company retains the right to modify, manage, control and/or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods at its sole discretion. Prices and availability of Virtual Goods are subject to change without notice. We shall have no liability to you or any third party for the exercise of such rights.

You have no other right, title or interest in or to any such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency appearing or originating in the Service.

**Product Descriptions:** We try to make the Service thorough, accurate, and helpful to our customers. Nonetheless, there may be times when certain information contained on the Service may be incorrect, incomplete, or inaccurate, or appear inaccurate because of the browser, hardware, software, or other technology that you use. Discord reserves the right, with or without prior notice, to: change descriptions or references to products and/or services; limit the available quantity of any product or service; honor, or refuse to honor, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code or other similar promotions; and/or refuse to provide any visitor to, or use of the Service with any product or service.

**Availability and Pricing:** Though we try to honor all purchase requests, availability cannot always be guaranteed. When an item is not available and cannot be replenished — for example, if we offer a limited promotion — we will attempt to remove the item from the Service in a timely manner but make no guarantees in this regard. We may occasionally make errors in the stated prices on the Service. If a product’s correct price is higher than the listed price, we will either confirm that we’ll provide the item at the price listed or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.

**Payments:** Since we use an intermediary, we abide by the agreements of the intermediary firm.

We may, in our sole discretion, cancel your payment at any time by providing notice to you through your contact information or by a notice when you attempt to make a payment. We may cancel a payment or prevent you from initiating future payments for any reason, including, without limitation, the following: (i) if you attempt to use the Service in breach of any applicable law or regulation, including the card network rules or regulations; (ii) if you use the Service in breach of these Terms; (iii) if we suspect fraudulent, unlawful or improper activity regarding a payment; (iv) if we detect, in our sole discretion, that your payments have excessive disputes, high reversal rates or present a relatively high risk of losses; or (v) failure to cooperate in an investigation or provide additional information when requested.

**Refunds:** You should review it at.
